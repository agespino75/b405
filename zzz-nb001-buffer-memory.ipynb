Imagine you're cooking and you chop up vegetables before you need to cook them. Instead of chopping each vegetable right before it goes in the pan, you chop them all at once and put them aside on a cutting board. That cutting board with the chopped vegetables is like a buffer — it holds everything ready for you until you're ready to use it. This way, when you need the vegetables, they are all prepared and ready to go, making the cooking process smoother and faster.\n",
